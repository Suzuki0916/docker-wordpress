# Using Wordpress with SSL enabled integrated with NGINX proxy and autorenew LetsEncrypt certificates

![wordpress-docker-letsencrypt](https://github.com/evertramos/images/raw/master/wordpress.jpg)

This docker-compose should be used with [NGINX Proxy Automation](https://github.com/evertramos/nginx-proxy-automation.


### Usage

After everything is settle, and you have your three containers running (_proxy, generator and letsencrypt_) you do the following:

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/evertramos/docker-wordpress.git
```

2. Update the service name in your _docker-compose.yml_ file **VERY IMPORTANT**

You must use any name, but make sure it is a unique service name in your environment, otherwise it will conflict with other services. 

3. Configure your _.env_ file:

Copy .env.sample to .env and update with your data

> The proxy network must match the network name you have set in the proxy settings. 

4. Start your project

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

**Be patient** - when you first run this repo, the database might take sometime to launch and the process of getting a new certificate for your domain might take some time.

#### Make sure the wordpress data files has user and group set to **www-data**, so you could update, install, delete files from your admin panel.

### Further Options

#### wp-cli (https://wp-cli.org/)

For whoever uses *wp-cli* here is how to implement it on this repo. 


Test to see if itÂ´s working

```bash
./wp-cli-test.sh

```

If you would, add the alias "wp" to your `.bash_aliases`:

```bash
alias wp="docker-compose run --rm wpcli"
```

Next time you need to run a wp-cli command just go to where you have your docker-compose file and run a `wp` command.

----

### Known Issues

#### Azure

Running docker on Azure servers you must mount your database in your disks partitions (example: `/mnt/data/`) so your db container can work. This is a some kind of issue regarding Hyper-V sharing drivers... not really sure why.
